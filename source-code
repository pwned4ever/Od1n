 my patches and additions on top of pongo's code are licensed under the ABGS ("Anyone But GeoSnow") license. note that an additional exception to the license is added, forbidding use/redistribution of said content to his fans as well, but only when in a 50,000 mile radius from "GeoSnow" or while holding any sort of (video)conference/chat with him.

note that this license will only be used as long as what would capstone decode / that one other arm64 ida plugin thing by Nyaaaaa ("Xai0o0o0o0") + 5 other developers are not under the MIT license. afterwards, all exceptions are cleared and basically WTFPL applies"

If you're looking for the source code. Go and copy pasta as many projects you can and create your own source code lmfao, good luck with that..
