new jailbreakd(dopamine jbd) thx to @opa334dev(Lars F) and @ycs_dev(Hoa H).
new jailbraeking method. new patches. completely rewritten to adapt all the new changes. 
much faster. 
no internet required(does not download kernelcache like other jailbreaks)
no trollstore installation method needed. ( this app can be installed any way you are capable of installing 3rd party apps - ie: sideloady, Altstore, 3utools etc)
with new powers comes new responsibilities.
